				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>As mentioned in the last post, the idea was only an online donation portal and nothing even vaguely connected to volunteering. But, as most successful entrepreneurs say, one has to be open to new ideas and one must be willing to change existing ideas. And so, we were open and receptive. Our idea indeed undergo significant transformations since that camp in February. </b></p>
<p><i><u>March &#8217;13:</u></i><br />
<i><u><br />
</u></i><b>After my eleventh grade finals got over, I was contemplating on trying community service again. However, being a student of an integrated program preparing for iit-jee, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t have much time. But I convinced myself that I would be able to spare three hours a week. I went online and started searching for volunteering opportunities in Mumbai. To my utter dismay, the search didn&#8217;t lead me anywhere. There were just too many nonprofit organisations and all I was getting was a list of them along with the cause. How was I supposed to decide where to volunteer? Which organisation was right for me? Which ones were the ones which needed most help? Which ones were most effective and creating maximum impact? Which ones were genuine and authentic?</b></p>
<p><b><b><br />
</b>These questions remained unanswered and the process of searching for volunteering opportunities was just too tedious a job. I didn&#8217;t have the time to check up on each organisation&#8217;s website, call them up and find out which one would be the best one for me.</b><b><br />
</b><br />
<b>I guess you can see where I am going with this..But no, the idea for SevaConnect didn&#8217;t hit me until a few weeks later. More of that in the next post!</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“is there anything else I could do to help out? Maybe something like organizing a fundraiser or advertising your organization on social media or something?”</strong><br />
<strong>The lady sitting in front of me looked at me as if I had said something improbably absurd. “No, you can only volunteer to teach kids. These great ideas of yours, leave it to the staff here.” The delicate sunlight, coming from the partially curtained windows irradiated parts of the office, as I sat, seemingly unabashed by the remarks of the head of Ashray, a non-profit organization for underprivileged kids where I was going to volunteer. I wondered if I would be able to do it well. I am generally impatient by nature. And, I believe teaching little kids requires a substantially degree of patience. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless, I showed up the next day to begin teaching kids. I was paired with this cute, seven year old girl and was told to teach her math, one of my favorite subjects at school. So I went up to the girl and said, “you like math?” “no, I like playing.” “Well, from now, you are going to like math as well. Let’s begin”. I felt really up to this new challenge in front of me. Half an hour later, my enthusiasm had pretty much died. The first fifteen minutes had been spent trying to explain the concept of multiplication (which, I am pretty sure, went over her head), the other fifteen, chasing the obstinate girl around the campus for she just did not want to study. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After three days of volunteering, and trying out three different kids, I  guess I couldn&#8217;t see the value in it or may be I was too impatient. I wanted to make impact, huge impact. I really wished to do something which would benefit all of these children in a huge way, say, by getting them enrolled in good schools, hiring professionals to teach them here. So I quit teaching kids there. I realized I was too impatient for the job.So that was the beginning and the end of volunteering for me. </strong></p>
